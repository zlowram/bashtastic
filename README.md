# Bashtastic

Bashtastic is a framework for easy and comfortable bash configuration
management. Forget about editing the (sometimes) long .bashrc file! Now you
can have your configuration splitted in different files, each one for a
concrete purpose!

Don't you have it yet? What the hell are you waiting for?!

GO AND INSTALL IT! :D 

## Current version
Current version is v0.1.

## Features
There are still few features, but many more will soon be added. By now, you can
enjoy those:
    * Multiple-files configuration (forget about having only the .bashrc file!)
    * Themes support

## Install
To install Bashtastic you only have to clone the repo and execute the
`install.sh` script you will find inside. Easy peasy!

## Who the hell did this?
It was [Sergi Martínez-Bea](http://www.zlowram.net) also known as zlOwram. You
can find me on twitter under the [@zlowram](http://twitter.com/zlowram) tag
(c'mon! go and follow me!).
